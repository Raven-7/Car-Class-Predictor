# Car-Class-Predictor and Evaluation
This program predicts the Class to which a Car belongs to based on its features. Here, UCI datascience repository is used.
It uses KNN classification algorithm to predict the class to which the car belongs to based on some feature and attributes.

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

### These attributes are- 
* PRICE overall price
* buying buying price
* maint price of the maintenance
* TECH technical characteristics
* COMFORT comfort
* doors number of doors
* persons capacity in terms of persons to carry
* lug_boot the size of luggage boot
* safety estimated safety of the car
